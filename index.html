		<h1>Tiny Browser Simulator</h1>

		<p>
		While working at <a href="https://ncer.gov.ge">NCER</a>, there came a need
		for a <i>tiny</i> and light weight <i>browser simulator</i> built with
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>,
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a>, and
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">Javascript</a>
		which would support a very small subset of the modern browsers' features.
		</p>

		<p>
		Now, of course, I had to do it all manually &ndash; no LLMs, no frameworks
		(other than browsers, obviously). I knew that it would take no more than ~100
		lines of Javascript and about the same of CSS. I had sketched out the idea of
		how I wanted it to function a few days back, which is the single best thing I
		usually do when working on projects. Having an outline of work is super useful.
		</p>

		<h2>The Goal</h2>

		<p>
		There were a couple crucial features that I needed the simulator to support:
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Tabs (functional) and</li>
			<li>internal navigation using hyperlinks.</li>
		</ol>

		The idea is that the simulator should start with a single (or multiple) tabs
		open and then the user should be able to click the links inside the simulated
		page to summon new tabs. Then the user should be able to switch to tabs.

		<h2>The Interface</h2>

		<p>
		As the html code for the simulator will need to be generated via a 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">GUI</a>, it
		needs to be very simple so that implementing the generation is not too painful.
		I had a few different ideas of the way the HTML could look but I settled on
		what I think is best (why wouldn't I): Have a single <code>&lt;browser-sim&gt;
		</code> element and nest different <code>&lt;browser-page&gt;</code> elements
		containing the content, the title, and the url of each page.
		</p>

		<p>
		This way, the code would be super easy to generate and also read and modify
		by hand if necessary. It would literally be different elements for different
		pages, can't get any simpler than that.
		</p>

		<h2>The Execution</h2>
		
		<p>
		As you might have suspected, this is exactly what it turned out to be like.
		Here's some example code:
		</p>

		<pre><code id="example-1-source"></code></pre>

		And here's what it looks like running:

<browser-sim id="example-1">
	<browser-page title="Welcome" url="brow.ser">
		<h1>Hello!</h1>
		<p>
		This is a lesson about clicking links. Clicking 
		<browser-link to="dark.web">this link</browser-link>
		will take you to a dark place. Or
		<browser-link to="youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ">this one</browser-link>
		for eternal salvation.
		</p>
	</browser-page>
	
	<browser-page title="The Dark Web" url="dark.web">
		<h1>This is not the dark web</h1>
		<p>
		Hahaha! Just kidding, this is not really the dark web. Follow 
		<browser-link to="youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ">this link</browser-link>.
		</p>
	</browser-page>

	<browser-page title="a good place to be" url="youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ">
		<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ"></iframe>
	</browser-page>
</browser-sim>

		<!-- <p> -->
		<!-- The way it works is quite simple. I've defined  -->
